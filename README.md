# ImageEncoder

Encodes/Decodes hidden messages into image files.
For Windows.

# Intructions

Typically the .exe file will download the required library. 
If not, install both Python and the required pillow library. 
When entering the path of the image file, always make sure that the path indicated is not under quotations, as python won't recognize it. 
When entering the path of the output image, do not just enter a directory and the image file needs to be a .png instead of .jpeg. As the .jpeg compression destroys the LSB data.
